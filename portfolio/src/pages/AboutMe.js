					About Me
				</h1>
				<p>
					After spending the past decade working as a paramedic and
					ICU nurse, my passion for technology led me to pursue a
					career transition into software engineering. Drawing upon
					the critical thinking skills honed in the medical field, I
					now thrive on tackling complex coding challenges, applying
					the problem-solving acumen I cultivated during my years as a
					paramedic and ICU nurse to develop innovative software
					solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					During my time as a paramedic, I had the privilege of
					serving the communities of the South Side of Chicago for
					four years and Detroit for another four. These experiences
					provided me with a solid foundation in emergency medical
					care, crisis management, and effective teamwork. The
					challenges I faced during this time honed my critical
					thinking abilities, quick decision-making skills, and the
					ability to remain calm under pressure – attributes that
					prove invaluable in any field, particularly in the
					fast-paced world of technology.
				</p>

				<p>
					Seeking further growth and a deeper understanding of patient
					care, I transitioned into the role of an ICU nurse in
					Detroit. As an ICU nurse, I worked tirelessly to provide
					specialized care to critically ill patients, collaborating
					with interdisciplinary teams and employing evidence-based
					practices to deliver optimal outcomes. This role allowed me
					to develop exceptional clinical skills, enhance my ability
					to handle complex medical cases, and further refine my
					critical thinking abilities – which is transferable and
					highly sought-after in the tech industry.
				</p>

				<p>
					Driven by a desire for continuous learning and a keen
					interest in problem-solving, I decided to explore the field
					of technology. Recognizing the parallels between the
					critical thinking and analytical skills required in
					healthcare and those valued in the tech industry, I eagerly
					sought out new opportunities. With the goal of transitioning
					into tech, I attended a Hack Reactor bootcamp – an intensive
					and immersive learning experience that provided me with a
					strong foundation in software development and programming.
				</p>

				<p>
					My journey from healthcare to tech has equipped me with a
					unique blend of skills, including a strong work ethic,
					adaptability, attention to detail, and the ability to
					collaborate effectively with diverse teams. Combining my
					experiences in healthcare with my newfound knowledge in
					technology, I am excited to leverage this diverse skill set
					in pursuing new challenges and contributing to the growth
					and innovation within the tech industry.
