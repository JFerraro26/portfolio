				About Me
			</h1>
			<p>
				After spending the past decade working as a paramedic and ICU
				nurse, my passion for technology led me to pursue a career
				transition into software engineering. Drawing upon the critical
				thinking skills honed in the medical field, I now thrive on
				tackling complex coding challenges, applying the problem-solving
				acumen I cultivated during my years as a paramedic and ICU nurse
				to develop innovative software solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				During my time as a paramedic, I had the privilege of serving
				the communities of the South Side of Chicago for four years and
				Detroit for another four. These experiences provided me with a
				solid foundation in emergency medical care, crisis management,
				and effective teamwork. The challenges I faced during this time
				honed my critical thinking abilities, quick decision-making
				skills, and the ability to remain calm under pressure –
				attributes that prove invaluable in any field, particularly in
				the fast-paced world of technology.
			</p>

			<p>
				Seeking further growth and a deeper understanding of patient
				care, I transitioned into the role of an ICU nurse in Detroit.
				As an ICU nurse, I worked tirelessly to provide specialized care
				to critically ill patients, collaborating with interdisciplinary
				teams and employing evidence-based practices to deliver optimal
				outcomes. This role allowed me to develop exceptional clinical
				skills, enhance my ability to handle complex medical cases, and
				further refine my critical thinking abilities – which is
				transferable and highly sought-after in the tech industry.
			</p>

			<p>
				Driven by a desire for continuous learning and a keen interest
				in problem-solving, I decided to explore the field of
				technology. Recognizing the parallels between the critical
				thinking and analytical skills required in healthcare and those
				valued in the tech industry, I eagerly sought out new
				opportunities. With the goal of transitioning into tech, I
				attended a Hack Reactor bootcamp – an intensive and immersive
				learning experience that provided me with a strong foundation in
				software development and programming.
			</p>

			<p>
				My journey from healthcare to tech has equipped me with a unique
				blend of skills, including a strong work ethic, adaptability,
				attention to detail, and the ability to collaborate effectively
				with diverse teams. Combining my experiences in healthcare with
				my newfound knowledge in technology, I am excited to leverage
				this diverse skill set in pursuing new challenges and
				contributing to the growth and innovation within the tech
				industry.
